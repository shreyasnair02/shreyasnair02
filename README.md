## Greetings, fellow humans! ðŸ¤–
I'm Shreyas, a CS student with a passion for Web Development, 
When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest and greatest in the world of technology, especially when it comes to Linux and its tools. I love to make stuff and am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
